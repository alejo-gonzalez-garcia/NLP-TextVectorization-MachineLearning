In this project, we have performed a multi-class classification task of literary poems, which will be assigned to a period. We have collected and processed 
the raw data in order to apply Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning tools, with techniques such as feature extraction and selection, topic modeling, text preprocessing and classification.

WebScrapping related files allow us to collect the necessary data from the specific web page, 
The Dashboard file shows a simple application in which you can collect information about a specific poem and the topic to which it belongs. 
If you run it completely, you can enter in this URL “http://localhost:8050/” and see the web page.   

Preprocessing&Topics&Classification is the main file, where we perform Data Preprocessing, Text Vectorization, Topic Modeling and Classification of the poems.
