In this project, we have performed a multiclass classification task of previously preprocessed poems, that will be assigned to a period. 
Natural Language Processing and Machine learning tools have been used, such as feature extraction and selection, topic modelling, text preprocessing and classification.

Files related to WebScrapping allow us to collect the required data from the specific web page, 
Dashboard file shows a simple application where you can gather some information about any specific poem and the topic it belongs to. 
If you fully execute it, you can enter in this URL "http://localhost:8050/" and see the web page.   

Preprocessing&Topics&Classification is the main file, where we perform Data Preprocessing, Text Vectorization, Topic Modelling and Classification of the poems.
